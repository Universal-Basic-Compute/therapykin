                  <p className="text-foreground/80">
                    TherapyKin is an AI-powered therapeutic companion that builds a genuine relationship with you over time. Unlike traditional therapy apps that reset with each session, TherapyKin remembers your history, learns your preferences, and evolves alongside you, providing personalized mental health support.

                  <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-4">
                    TherapyKin stands apart in several key ways:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
                    <li><strong>Continuous Memory:</strong> Unlike apps that treat each session as isolated, TherapyKin builds on previous conversations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationship Building:</strong> The more you interact, the more personalized the support becomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible Communication:</strong> Seamlessly switch between text and voice based on your preference.</li>
                    <li><strong>24/7 Availability:</strong> Get support exactly when you need it, not just during scheduled sessions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy-First Design:</strong> End-to-end encryption and comprehensive privacy controls.</li>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Is TherapyKin a replacement for traditional therapy?</h3>
                  <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-4">
                    TherapyKin is not a replacement for professional mental health treatment. It's designed to complement traditional therapy by providing ongoing support between sessions, reinforcing skills learned in therapy, and offering assistance when your therapist isn't available.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-foreground/80">
                    Many users find the greatest benefit comes from using TherapyKin alongside traditional therapy. If you're experiencing a mental health emergency or crisis, please contact emergency services or a crisis helpline immediately.

                  <p className="text-foreground/80 mb-4">
                    TherapyKin incorporates evidence-based approaches including:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-foreground/80">
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Identifying and changing unhelpful thought patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):</strong> Building skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness</li>
                    <li><strong>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):</strong> Accepting difficult thoughts and feelings while committing to behavior change</li>
                    <li><strong>Mindfulness Practices:</strong> Developing present-moment awareness and non-judgmental attention</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive Psychology:</strong> Focusing on strengths, resilience, and positive experiences</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mt-4 text-foreground/80">
                    TherapyKin adapts these approaches based on your specific needs and what works best for you.

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Can I switch between text and voice communication?</h3>
                  <p className="text-foreground/80">
                    Yes! You can seamlessly switch between text and voice communication at any point during a session. Start typing and switch to voice if you find it easier to express yourself that way, or vice versa. TherapyKin maintains context across both modalities, so your conversation flows naturally regardless of how you choose to communicate.

                    TherapyKin adapts to your needs and schedule. You can have brief 5-minute check-ins during busy days, longer 30-minute sessions for deeper exploration, or anything in between. There are no time limits or scheduling requirementsâ€”use TherapyKin in whatever way works best for you, whenever you need support.

                  <p className="text-foreground/80">
                    Sessions are only counted if they are more than 5 minutes long. This policy allows you to change your mind, refresh the page, or recover from accidental clicks without using up your session allowance. If you connect with TherapyKin for less than 5 minutes, it won't count against your session limit or subscription usage.
